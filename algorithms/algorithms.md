## Algorithms in C++


### Bubble sort
Works by looping the elements and swapping and two elements that are not in order.
 
 ### Selection sort
 Works by scanning the array for the least item in the array, and swaps it with the last element in the sorted part of 
 the array. At any one time, the array is divided onto two parts, sorted part(on the left) and the unsorted part(on the right).
 It has a Big O(nLog(n))
 
 ### Insertion sort
 Take the first element, assume it's sorted, take the next element, compare with the already sorted one if the number is 
 less, swap the two, pick the next element, check with the existing ones, swap till it's in the correct position
