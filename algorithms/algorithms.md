## Algorithms in C++


### Bubble sort
Works by looping the elements and swapping and two elements that are not in order.
 
 ### Selection sort
 Works by scanning the array for the least item in the array, and swaps it with the last element in the sorted part of 
 the array. At any one time, the array is divided onto two parts, sorted part(on the left) and the unsorted part(on the right).
 It has a Big O(nLog(n))
